About Me ?
# Hey 👋 I'm Emmanuel!

I'm a Frontend Developer with a curious mind, always exploring new ways to bring ideas to life through code. I love clean UI, smooth animations, and building stuff that actually *works*.

Right now, I’m learning:
- 🚀 React + TypeScript (my new favorite duo)
- 🎨 Framer Motion for scroll-based animations
- 📦 Material UI (MUI) for clean UI components
- ⚡️ API handling with Axios + React Hooks

> *I believe the best way to grow is to build... and break things along the way.*
